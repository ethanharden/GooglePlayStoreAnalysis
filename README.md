# Google Play Store Analysis
## Applied Data Mining & Predictive Analytics Final Project
In this study, we utilize logistic regression to examine app success determinants in the
Google Play Store, using data from 2010 to 2018. We identify key predictors—rating, reviews,
and price—that significantly impact app performance, measured by installs. Our machine
learning model achieves a training accuracy of 93.62% and a test accuracy of 94.56%, with an F1
score of 0.94, indicating precise classification. These findings offer actionable insights for
developers and marketers, enhancing understanding of app success factors. Future research
directions include exploring alternative algorithms and considering external factors like
economic trends and technological advancements. Overall, our study advances comprehension of
app success drivers and guides future research in this field.
